Cameo uses the custom c# code from Combined Arms,
which extends the original OpenRA engine. The code
is very well structured and allows us to implement
many desirable features. We are very thankful for 
this codebase and highly recommend everyone to have
a look at this great mod.

Combined Arms developers:
	* Inq (Project lead)
	* Darkademic (Art & Balanace)

Contributors & special thanks to:
	* GraionDilach (C#)
	* MustaphaTR (C#)
	* Boolbada (C#)
